Most of the files are me figuring out how to do this. If you want to run the code, then you only need the sudoku_aux.py and sudokusolver.py

It's not optimal by any stretch of the imagination. Most of the solves are sub one-minute. However, there is a mathematician from 
Finland, Arto Inkala, who did a lot of work to find the hardest sudoku puzzles ever. His puzzles are solved in less than 15minutes.
